# Eth-beginner-Project
This is the project of eth beginner course in which we are creating a Token.


## Description
In this project, we have created a smart contract for a token. The contract includes variables for the token name, abbreviation, and total supply. We have also implemented a balance mapping that maps addresses to their respective token balances. Additionally, we have created mint and burn functions. The mint function increases the total supply by a specified value and credits it to a given address, while the burn function decreases the total supply by a specified value and debits it from a given address, provided the address has sufficient balance.

## Featurea
- Token Name and Abbreviation: Easily identifiable token with a name and abbreviation.
- Total Supply Management: Tracks the total supply of the token.
- Balance Mapping: Maps each address to uint.
- Mint Function: Allows for the creation of new tokens and adding them to an address.
- Burn Function: Allows for the destruction of tokens from an address, reducing the total supply.

## Learning Outcomes
- How to create a basic smart contract using Solidity.
- How to declare and use state variables.
- How to implement mapping for address balances.
- How to write functions to modify state variables.
- How to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE, for compiling and deploying smart contracts.


## Executing program
To execute this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

- Visit the Remix website.
- Compile the smart contract.
- Deploy the compiled contract to a blockchain network (e.g., the Ethereum testnet).
- Interact with the deployed contract using the Remix interface to mint and burn tokens.

### Summary
The smart contract, MyToken, includes key functionalities for token management, such as defining the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply. It also features a balance mapping for tracking token balances of addresses, and functions to mint and burn tokens.By completing this project, I have gained hands-on experience with:
Writing and understanding Solidity code.
Using state variables and mappings.
Implementing functions to manage token supply.
Deploying and interacting with smart contracts using Remix, an online Solidity IDE.
